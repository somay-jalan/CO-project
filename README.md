The assembler_final.py inside Simple_Assembler folder inside the CO_A_P1 inside CO_A_P1 conatins the assembler with stdin and stdout for the assembler assignment. The assembler_final.py inside final_assembler folder on main branch contains assembler with input from "input.txt" and output to "output.txt".


The final_simulator folder contains the simulator which will take binary input as stdin and output the trace as stdout


Automated testing works for both simulator and assembler.


Q3 folder contains folder with simulator code and assembler code for Q3. The assembler takes input from "assembly.txt" file and outputs a "bin.txt" file . The simulator takes "bin.txt" file as input and outputs "trace.txt" file.
